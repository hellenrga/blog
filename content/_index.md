# Hi, I'm Hellen Assis.

Welcome to my blog. I’m 19-year-old Software Engineer from Brazil.

I created this website to share my journey, insights, and learnings in the world of technology. Here, you’ll find my thoughts on a variety of technical topics, including Microsoft Azure, Kubernetes, Docker, Cloud-Native Technologies, DevOps, and Linux.

As I continue to explore and deepen my knowledge in these areas, I aim to provide valuable content that can inspire and help others who are also passionate about tech.
