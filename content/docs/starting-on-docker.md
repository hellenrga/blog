# Diving into DevOps

I already have a solid foundation in DevOps tools through my professional experience and studies, I believe thereâ€™s always room to deepen my understanding. To strengthen my knowledge further, I decided to revisit the basics and embark on a Starter DevOps course offered by Alura, one of Brazilâ€™s premier tech education platforms.

This course spanned 32 hours and was divided into three modules: **Linux CLI, Secure Traffic, and Docker.** Each module built upon the fundamentals and provided hands-on experience, ensuring a well-rounded grasp of essential DevOps concepts.

Hereâ€™s the certification for completing this journey:

## 1 | Linux Server and CLI

Though Linux has been a familiar playground for meâ€”it was my primary operating system for a couple of yearsâ€”I had primarily used it in a desktop environment. But at some point I eventually switched back to other OSs because it didn't have support for games (ðŸ˜…) but I still continued playing around with Linux through virtual machines for coding.

This course introduced me to **Linux Server**, which was a new challenge. Using **SSH connections**, I set up and managed a server, gaining hands-on experience with server environments.  

One of the most fascinating aspects was learning **Shell Scripting** for task automation. I wrote scripts to:  
- **Back up files**,  
- **Compress and decompress data**,  
- **Convert images from JPG to PNG**, and more.  

These scripts were a gateway to understanding how automation streamlines workflows. Iâ€™ve uploaded them to my **Homelab repository**â€”feel free to explore it [here](https://github.com/hellenrga/homelab).

## 2 | Web Communication and Security

Although I already had a strong understanding of the fundamentals of web communications from my college studies, I found it valuable to revisit and deepen my knowledge of HTTP protocols and associated tools. I had the opportunity to explore a variety of essential topics and hands-on practices that enhanced my skillset.

### Key Learning Outcomes

- **Postman Usage**: Gained practical experience using **Postman** to debug HTTP requests, configure headers, and test authentication methods, enhancing my understanding of secure communication.

- **Session & Cookie Management**: Implemented **cookies** and **sessions** to maintain user identity across requests, reinforcing knowledge of stateful web communication.

- **OpenSSL & Encryption**: Explored **OpenSSL** for encryption and delved into **SSL/TLS layers** to secure data transmission and protect client-server communication.

- **Networking Protocols**: Revisited **UDP** and **TCP** protocols for reliable data transmission, and learned about **QUIC** as part of the next-gen **HTTP/3** for better performance and security.

## 3 | Docker

I had minimal prior experience with Docker, and this course allowed me to deepen my understanding of containerization and orchestration. After gaining a foundational understanding of what Docker is and how it works, I started creating containers, interacting with them, and managing images. I worked with Docker commands to run web applications within containers.

I used the following command to run an application in the background, exposing all available ports:

```bash
docker run -d -P docker/example
```

Additionally, I specified the ports to open for access to the application using the following command:

```bash
docker run -d -p docker/example 3000:80
```

For example, I was able to run a web application on port 8080 and access it locally.

I also learned to manage Docker processes, such as stopping running containers:

```bash
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
```

Moreover, I learned how to create Docker images using the following command:

```bash
docker build -t <tag>
```

In addition to these basic Docker operations, I explored mechanisms for data persistence, such as **volumes**, **bind mounts**, and **tmpfs**. These methods help ensure that data is stored securely and persists across container restarts.

Example of using **tmpfs** for temporary storage:

```bash
docker run -it --mount type=tmpfs,target=/tmp ubuntu
```

### Building a DevOps Mindset  

This initial phase of my DevOps learning journey has not only expanded my technical toolkit but has also deepened my understanding of how modern infrastructures operate. Iâ€™m excited to continue exploring Docker, Kubernetes, and beyond, as I pursue a future in cloud-native technologies and scalable systems.

Next, I'll be diving into Kubernetes and exploring advanced container orchestration. Stay tuned for more!
