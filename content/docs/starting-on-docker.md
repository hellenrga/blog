# DevOps Course (Linux CLI, Docker..)

Hi, I have already had some previous contact with Docker on my first year of college and also I have heard about it at my actual job. So to deepen my knowledge I decided to follow an DevOps course journey from a brazilian tech school named 'Alura' (which I think is one of the biggest code schools in Brazil). The first trilha was 32-hours long with the total of 4 courses finished, which approached first Linux CLI, Secure Traffic, GitHub and finally, Docker.

here is the course certificate ![](/static/start-devops-certificate.png)

## 1. Linux CLI

Linux isn't a mystery for me, as it was my main Operational System for years, i've always liked the way it looks and works, but because I didn't use it only for professional means, at some point I uninstalled it because it didn't had support for games (ðŸ˜…) and started using a VM always when I wanted to play around with it.
