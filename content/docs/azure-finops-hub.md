# What is Azure FinOps Hub?

The Azure FinOps Hub is a community-driven template designed to consolidate Azure financial management tools as Cost Management + Billing, Azure Advisor, Azure Policy etc. into a **single interface**. Simple as that. 

(Why is it so hard to find straightforward concepts on internet these days?)

Even though the template is community-made, it's recognized by Microsoft Azure itself, and has a Azure Learn page dedicated for it. Read it [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-computing/finops/toolkit/hubs/finops-hubs-overview).

## But why using it if... I already have all the other tools?

Yes, that's the whole point. Because you have too many tools and if you've already partipated on FinOps initiatives you know you have to use them all, and how this can be a little bit difficulting. So, the point of the template is concating them all together. Period.
