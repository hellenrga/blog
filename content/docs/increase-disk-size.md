In this guide, Iâ€™ll walk you through the process of increasing the disk size of a VirtualBox virtual machine (VM) and allocating the additional space using GParted.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Access the Virtual Media Manager
Go to the **Virtual Media Manager** of the VM you want to resize. You can find this under **File > Virtual Media Manager**.

### 2. Select the Disk to Resize
Find the disk you want to increase in size and double-click it.

### 3. Increase Disk Size
At the bottom of the screen, drag the slider to the right to increase the disk size to your desired value.

---

### 4. Verify Disk Size in the VM
Start your VM and run the following command in the terminal to check the disk size: 

```bash
df -h
```

Youâ€™ll notice that the size remains the same because the additional space hasnâ€™t been allocated yet.

### 5. Download GParted ISO
Weâ€™ll use **GParted** to allocate the new disk space. Download the ISO file [here](https://gparted.org/download.php).

### 6. Attach the GParted ISO
1. In VirtualBox, go to the **Settings** of the VM you want to resize.
2. Navigate to **Storage**.
3. Click on **Add Optical Drive**.

### 7. Select the GParted ISO
1. Click **Add** and locate the GParted `.iso` file you just downloaded.
2. Select the ISO, then click **Choose** at the bottom of the screen.

### 8. Boot the VM with GParted
Start the VM. You should see the following screen:

### 9. Launch GParted
When prompted, press `Enter` again to proceed with the default options.

### 10. GParted Interface
Once GParted loads, youâ€™ll see its graphical interface:

### 11. Resize the Partition
1. Double-click the partition you want to resize.
2. Drag the slider to allocate the remaining unallocated space.
3. Click **Resize/Move**.

### 13. Detach the GParted ISO
1. Shut down the VM.
2. Go to **Settings > Storage**.
3. Remove the GParted ISO from the **Optical Drive**.

### 14. Verify the New Disk Size
Start your VM again. Run the following command to check the new disk size:

```bash
df -h
```

You should now see the updated disk size.
