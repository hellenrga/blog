# About Me

I am a 19-year-old Software Engineering student with a deep passion for technology. Currently, I work in the Cloud Solutions sector for the agribusiness industry, where I focus on leveraging cutting-edge technologies to solve real-world challenges. My main area of expertise is DevOps and Microsoft Azure, a field that perfectly aligns with my fascination for innovative problem-solving and system efficiency.

My journey into tech began early. At the age of 12, I embarked on self-directed coding studies, which marked my first foray into programming. A year later, I enrolled in a technical course in Systems Analysis and Development, where I was able to deepen my knowledge and gain practical experience. By the time I completed the 3-year program, I was ready to take the next step: pursuing a Software Engineering degree. Since then, I have immersed myself in both academic and personal projects, constantly pushing the boundaries of my skills.

I am Azure Certified and committed to continuous learning and thrive on exploring new technologies and methodologies.
